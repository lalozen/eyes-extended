Generate a Discord server template with categories and channels. Format the output as follows:

Category: <Category Name>
- Channel: """<Channel Name>""" (Private) (Read_Only) (No_Threads)
- Channel: """<Channel Name>""" (Slow_Mode) (NSFW) (File_Upload) (No_Reactions)
- Voice: """<Voice Channel Name>""" (Private) (Mod_Only) (limit 10)
- Voice: """<Voice Channel Name>""" (limit 5)
- Forum: """<Forum Channel Name>""" (Post_guidelines: "Guidelines here") (Tags: ("Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3")) (default_reaction: 👍)
- Stage: """<Stage Channel Name>"""

General Instructions:
- Use various decorative symbols and emojis before channel names, such as "⸝⸝・🥕🐇︰", "🔔・", "💬┃", "⸝⸝・🥑︰"
- For voice channels, use decorative lines like "╰ ﹒— — — — — — ˊ˗" and "╰ ﹒o f f i c e  ⸝⸝ ﹕ɞ"
- Use lowercase letters for channel names, using hyphens or spaces as separators
- Include categories similar to the image, with MAIN as the primary category
- Place voice channels at the end of the category for decorative effect
- Ensure the template includes relevant channels for each category
- Use the following flags to set special permissions (multiple flags can be used for a single channel):
  - (Private): Only visible to specific roles
  - (Read_Only): Members can read but not write
  - (Mod_Only): Only visible to moderators
  - (No_Threads): Disables thread creation
  - (Slow_Mode): Enables slow mode (30 seconds)
  - (NSFW): Marks the channel as NSFW
  - (File_Upload): Allows file uploads
  - (No_Reactions): Disables reactions
  - (limit X): Sets a user limit for voice channels, where X is the maximum number of users
- Voice channels can have a (limit X) flag to set the maximum number of users
- Voice channels can only be (Mod_Only), not (Read_Only)
- Mark channels that should be private with "(Private)" and channels that are read-only for verified members with "(Read_Only)"
- Voice channels should be explicitly marked with "Voice:"
- Typically, server information channels such as rules and announcements are marked as "Read_Only"
- Consider using combinations of flags where appropriate, e.g., "(Read_Only, No_Reactions)" for announcement channels
- Add at least one Forum channel in an appropriate category
- Consider adding a Stage channel if relevant to the server theme
- Forum channels can have post guidelines, tags (up to 5), and a default reaction
- Stage channels typically don't have special permissions
- Ensure the template includes categories for Announcements, Events, and Community Engagement, each with relevant channels

Example channel names:

- Voice: """╰ ﹒— — — — — — ˊ˗"""
- Voice: """╰ ﹒o f f i c e  ⸝⸝ ﹕ɞ""" (limit 10)
- Stage: """⸝⸝ 🎭 ﹒s t a g e  ⸝⸝ ﹕ɞ"""

Note: Create a vintage-style server structure using text, voice, forum, and stage channels with decorative symbols and unique formatting. Arrange categories with voice channels at the end for aesthetic purposes. Use creative separators and emojis to maintain the vintage theme across all channel types, including forum and stage channels. Adapt the channel names and categories to fit the specific needs of the community while preserving the decorative vintage style.
