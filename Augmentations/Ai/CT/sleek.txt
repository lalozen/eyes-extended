Generate a Discord server template with categories and channels. Format the output as follows:

Category: <Category Name>
- Channel: """<Channel Name>""" (Private) (Read_Only) (No_Threads)
- Channel: """<Channel Name>""" (Slow_Mode) (NSFW) (File_Upload) (No_Reactions)
- Voice: """<Voice Channel Name>""" (Private) (Mod_Only) (limit 10)
- Voice: """<Voice Channel Name>""" (limit 5)
- Forum: """<Forum Channel Name>""" (Post_guidelines: "Guidelines here") (Tags: ("Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3")) (default_reaction: üëç)
- Stage: """<Stage Channel Name>"""

General Instructions:
- Use the stylized comma "Ôºå" followed by a space before each channel name (e.g., """Ôºå guide""")
- Use lowercase letters for channel names, avoiding hyphens (e.g., """Ôºå general chat""")
- Include categories similar to the image: STRAIGHT OFF DA CLOCK, HIT THRU TIME, RUNNING OUTTA TIME, DEAD ON TIME, TIME MAGAZINE, ITS 7AM, RUN UP DA CLOCK
- Ensure the template includes relevant channels for each category
- Use the following flags to set special permissions (multiple flags can be used for a single channel):
  - (Private): Only visible to specific roles
  - (Read_Only): Members can read but not write
  - (Mod_Only): Only visible to moderators
  - (No_Threads): Disables thread creation
  - (Slow_Mode): Enables slow mode (30 seconds)
  - (NSFW): Marks the channel as NSFW
  - (File_Upload): Allows file uploads
  - (No_Reactions): Disables reactions
  - (limit X): Sets a user limit for voice channels, where X is the maximum number of users
- Voice channels can have a (limit X) flag to set the maximum number of users
- Voice channels can only be (Mod_Only), not (Read_Only)
- Mark channels that should be private with "(Private)" and channels that are read-only for verified members with "(Read_Only)"
- Voice channels should be explicitly marked with "Voice:"
- Typically, server information channels such as rules and announcements are marked as "Read_Only"
- Include voice channels in relevant categories
- Consider using combinations of flags where appropriate, e.g., "(Read_Only, No_Reactions)" for announcement channels
- Add at least one Forum channel in an appropriate category
- Consider adding a Stage channel if relevant to the server theme
- Forum channels can have post guidelines, tags (up to 5), and a default reaction
- Stage channels typically don't have special permissions
- Ensure the template includes categories for Announcements, Events, and Community Engagement, each with relevant channels

Example channel names:
- Channel: """Ôºåguide""" (Read_Only)
- Channel: """Ôºåtourists"""
- Channel: """Ôºårich"""
- Channel: """Ôºåpolls"""
- Channel: """Ôºåcomments"""
- Channel: """Ôºågiveaway"""
- Channel: """Ôºågallery"""
- Channel: """Ôºågallery"""
- Channel: """Ôºåpromos"""
- Voice: """Ôºåunmute""" (limit 10)
- Voice: """Ôºåhours""" (limit 10)
- Forum: """Ôºåcommunity ideas""" (Post_guidelines: "Share your thoughts!") (Tags: ("Suggestion", "Question", "Event", "Feedback", "Other")) (default_reaction: üí°)
- Stage: """Ôºåcommunity talks"""

Note: Create a well-organized server structure using text, voice, forum, and stage channels with the stylized comma naming convention. Arrange categories in a logical order, starting with important information and progressing to more specific or casual channels. The unique naming style should be consistent across all channel types, including forum and stage channels.
