Generate a Discord server template with categories and channels. Format the output as follows:

Category: <Category Name>
- Channel: """<Channel Name>""" (Private) (Read_Only) (No_Threads)
- Channel: """<Channel Name>""" (Slow_Mode) (NSFW) (File_Upload) (No_Reactions)
- Voice: """<Voice Channel Name>""" (Private) (Mod_Only) (limit 10)
- Voice: """<Voice Channel Name>""" (limit 5)
- Forum: """<Forum Channel Name>""" (Post_guidelines: "Guidelines here") (Tags: ("Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3")) (default_reaction: 👍)
- Stage: """<Stage Channel Name>"""

General Instructions:
- Use unique symbols and emojis at the start of channel names for decoration, such as 📜, 📢, 🎉, 🏆, 💬, 🔧, 🎮, etc.
- Separate the symbol from the channel name using a bullet point "•" (e.g., """📜•rules-tos""")
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens for channel names (e.g., """general-chat""", """off-topic""")
- Ensure the template includes categories for IMPORTANT, MISC, SUPPORT, CHATS, VOICE CHATS, and additional categories as needed.
- Use the following flags to set special permissions (multiple flags can be used for a single channel):
  - (Private): Only visible to specific roles
  - (Read_Only): Members can read but not write
  - (Mod_Only): Only visible to moderators
  - (No_Threads): Disables thread creation
  - (Slow_Mode): Enables slow mode (30 seconds)
  - (NSFW): Marks the channel as NSFW
  - (File_Upload): Allows file uploads
  - (No_Reactions): Disables reactions
  - (limit X): Sets a user limit for voice channels, where X is the maximum number of users
- Voice channels can have a (limit X) flag to set the maximum number of users.
- Voice channels can only be (Mod_Only), not (Read_Only).
- Mark channels that should be private with "(Private)" and channels that are read-only for verified members with "(Read_Only)".
- Voice channels should be explicitly marked with "Voice:".
- Typically, server information channels such as rules, announcements, and status are marked as "Read_Only".
- Include voice channels in relevant categories.
- Consider using combinations of flags where appropriate, e.g., "(Read_Only, No_Reactions)" for announcement channels.
- Add at least one Forum channel in an appropriate category
- Consider adding a Stage channel if relevant to the server theme
- Forum channels can have post guidelines, tags (up to 5), and a default reaction
- Stage channels typically don't have special permissions
- Ensure the template includes categories for Announcements, Events, and Community Engagement, each with relevant channels
